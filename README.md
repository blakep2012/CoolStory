==========

To Run:
  1. Run Unit Tests with nosetests

Things included:
	A classifier that determines whether the user is cool or not based on their tweet text
	
Things not included:
	The classifier is technically the 'core' algorithm however we will also include
	a cluster algorithm that will first cluster people based on their profile description (their 'about)
	After this cluster the classifier will be run on each cluster to determine your coolness.
	In this way, coolness has a meaning because you are being compared to people who share your interests.
